												<h3>Unit 1</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												<strong>What</strong><br>
												The rise of generative AI since late 2022 has been dramatic: systems capable of producing text, images, audio and video now permeate many domains, including computing, education, business and research. While the idea of AI isn’t new, the rapid scale, accessibility and general-purpose nature of today’s models mean we are facing a different set of rules and challenges. The readings for this unit (Kluge‑Corrêa et al., 2023; Deckard, 2023) focus on AI governance from a global perspective and the professional/ethical implications for computing practitioners. Kluge‑Corrêa et al. observe that although “a lot of work is taking place to define the values and ideas that should guide AI advances,” a key challenge is establishing consensus on those values given diverse stakeholder perspectives. Their meta-analysis of governance documents found common themes but also significant divergences across national, institutional and cultural boundaries.<br><br>

												Deckard (2023) addresses the role of computing professionals, ethics and codes of conduct in the age of AI, emphasising that ethics cannot be an afterthought: professional responsibility, accountability and transparency must be embedded in practice. In short, these readings set the scene: generative AI is disrupting the status quo, governance frameworks are struggling to keep up, and computing professionals must adapt to a new ethical, social and legal terrain.<br><br>

												<strong>So what</strong><br>
												Why does this matter for computing professionals and society? Several implications emerge. First, the lack of global consensus on AI values means systems developed in one context can carry assumptions that conflict elsewhere, causing legal, reputational and social risk. Second, generative AI blurs traditional boundaries of roles and responsibilities: when algorithmic systems act quasi‑autonomously the question “who is responsible?” becomes fuzzy, complicating liability, oversight and explainability. Third, the social dimension is substantial — bias, misinformation, labour disruption and environmental impact extend harms beyond direct users to communities and society. Fourth, legal and regulatory moves (AI laws, audits, transparency requirements) make compliance, auditability and governance operational necessities for practitioners.<br><br>

												<strong>Now what</strong><br>
												Given these reflections, here are practical steps for computing professionals, students and institutions:<br><br>
												1. Embed ethics and governance early — incorporate values, dataset transparency, human‑in‑the‑loop oversight and auditability from design onward. Adopt the strictest plausible standards where contexts vary.<br><br>
												2. Professional adaptation and certification — update professional identity beyond coding: internalise codes of conduct (BCS, ACM, etc.) and advocate for registered professionals in high‑stakes AI deployments.<br><br>
												3. Contextual governance and stakeholder engagement — involve users, affected communities and regulators; plan for cultural context and multi‑level governance frameworks.<br><br>
												4. Transparency, auditability and continuous monitoring — log, monitor and evaluate systems post‑deployment; provide redress mechanisms and prepare for regulatory audits.<br><br>
												5. Education and awareness — include ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) in curricula and professional development; keep up to date with national AI acts and standards.<br><br>
												6. Balance innovation and caution — match innovation goals with safeguards, intended use cases and mitigation or rollback plans.<br><br>
												7. Prepare for legal and professional accountability — ensure documentation, traceability and clear human decision points; seek complementary study in AI law and policy.<br><br>

												<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
												Unit 1 underscores that generative AI is a paradigm shift for computing professionals. The “What” describes the evolving technology and governance landscape; the “So What” explains why this matters; and the “Now What” outlines concrete actions practitioners and institutions should take to steward AI responsibly. Ignoring these issues risks bias, loss of trust and legal or reputational fallout. Proactive governance, ethical reflection and transparency can help steer generative AI toward beneficial outcomes.<br><br>

													<h3>Unit 2</h3>
												</header>
												<p>
												<strong>What</strong><br>
												My chosen topic, "Cloud computing for building effective information systems in the banking sector," directly relates to my professional environment, where my organisation is transitioning from legacy datacentres to cloud infrastructure as part of a cloud-first strategy. This shift aims to improve scalability, agility, and resilience across critical banking systems. The migration involves not only technical transformation but also changes to governance, data management, and security frameworks. Cloud adoption promises to modernise our information systems and enable real-time analytics, yet it also presents challenges in regulatory compliance, data sovereignty, and operational risk.<br><br>

												<strong>So What</strong><br>
												Reflecting on this transformation, I recognise how cloud computing is reshaping the very foundation of information systems in banking. It enables integration across platforms, supports advanced analytics, and reduces infrastructure costs, aligning with business agility goals (Marinescu, 2023). However, it also magnifies issues around confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, all of which are central to the financial sector's trust model (Alshamaila et al., 2021). For internal auditors and technology leaders, the shift demands new competencies: understanding shared-responsibility models, re-evaluating control frameworks, and aligning cloud practices with financial regulations such as the FCA and PRA operational resilience requirements. Personally, this reflection has helped me appreciate that technical migration alone is insufficient - cultural change, skill development, and risk governance must progress in parallel.<br><br>

												<strong>Now What</strong><br>
												Moving forward, I plan to deepen my technical and governance expertise in cloud security and regulatory compliance to support the organisation's strategic goals. Professionally, this means engaging with the audit and engineering teams to embed robust control testing in the cloud environment and ensuring that resilience and data protection principles are maintained – I have added an audit to this year's plan to deep into good practices in cloud environments using CIS benchmarks. Academically, I intend to explore comparative studies on hybrid versus multi-cloud adoption in finance to identify best practices for risk mitigation and operational efficiency. More broadly, I see the cloud-first journey as an opportunity for the banking industry to redefine what "effective" information systems mean. not just efficient or scalable, but secure, transparent, and compliant by design. Also, please refer to Unit 7 for the article submitted on building effective cloud environments, namely: "Cloud Computing for Building Effective Information Systems in Banking: A Standalone Literature Review".<br><br>

													<h3>Week 3</h3>
												</header>
												<p>
												<strong>Reflection Summary</strong><br>
												My aim is to assess whether LLM-assisted coding increases or decreases software vulnerabilities, fits within conclusive research, specifically a descriptive–causal design. The aim is to verify measurable effects rather than explore an undefined problem. An experimental method was chosen because it allows variable control and statistical testing to determine causal relationships.<br>
												Data is collected through static analysis tools (e.g., Semgrep, CodeQL, Bandit) and manual code reviews, ensuring both precision and reliability. This mixed approach links quantitative rigour with human validation.<br>
												To execute this, I need strong skills in software security, experimental design, and statistical modelling, as well as the ability to interpret results and manage ethical research processes. Going forward, I plan to develop deeper expertise in data analysis, SAST tools, and governance implications to strengthen both my project and my professional capability in evidence-based cybersecurity auditing.<br>

												This text highlights the importance of industry specific security standards and directives in the context of security and risk assessments. The standards play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of sensitive information and mitigating potential risks. These standards also help organizations to stay compliant with regulatory requirements and maintain credibility in the market.<br><br>

												Standards can greatly affect the outcome of security and risk assessments. Compliance with standards can help organizations to identify potential vulnerabilities and mitigate them before they can be exploited. Standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53 provide guidelines for implementing effective security controls, while regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA outline specific requirements for data protection and privacy.<br><br>

												Common industry and enterprise standards include ISO/IEC 27001, NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR. These standards are widely recognized and adopted by organizations across various industries.<br><br>

											<p>
												Quantitative risk modelling (QRM) is a crucial discipline in risk management that involves the use of statistical and mathematical techniques to analyze and measure risk. There are various approaches to QRM, including Monte Carlo Simulations and Bayes theoretical models. Monte Carlo Simulations involve the use of random sampling to generate a range of possible outcomes for a given set of variables. On the other hand, Bayes theoretical models rely on prior knowledge, assumptions, and subjective probability to assess risk.<br><br>

												Principles and antipatterns are also essential in QRM, as they help to ensure that the analysis is accurate and reliable. Some of the principles for Monte Carlo Simulations include defining the problem, specifying the input parameters, and validating the simulation. For Bayes theoretical models, the principles involve selecting the appropriate prior probability, updating the probability based on new information, and checking for model fit. Antipatterns, on the other hand, refer to common mistakes or pitfalls that can lead to inaccurate results in QRM.<br><br>

												This text covers the application of Quick Response Manufacturing (QRM) techniques to real-world problems. QRM is a set of strategies that aim to increase a company's competitiveness by reducing lead times, improving responsiveness, and increasing flexibility. The text also discusses how QRM techniques are used and provides a critical evaluation of some of the techniques available.<br><br>

												According to research by Suri (1998), QRM can help companies reduce lead times and improve responsiveness by organizing their production processes around focused cells, reducing setup times, and increasing the use of machines. QRM can also help companies increase flexibility by implementing a system of quick response orders, which allows them to quickly respond to changes in demand.<br><br>

												Some of the QRM techniques available include POLCA (Paired-cell Overlapping Loops of Cards with Authorization), which is a method of controlling the flow of jobs through a production process, and Q-ROC (Quick Response Order Control), which is a system of managing orders that allows companies to quickly respond to changes in demand.<br><br>

												However, QRM techniques are not without limitations. Research by Caggiano et al. (2018) suggests that QRM may not be effective in environments with high variability and low volumes. Additionally, implementing QRM can be complex and costly, requiring significant changes to a company's production processes.<br><br>

												This text discusses the importance of creating business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) plans, as well as the main determining factors in such plans. The main factors include Business Impact Assessments (BIA), Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs). Additionally, the text highlights some emerging trends in Information Risk Management. <br><br>

												According to Wang and Liu (2016), business continuity and disaster recovery plans are essential for organizations to ensure uninterrupted business operations. These plans should be based on a thorough understanding of the organization’s business processes and potential risks. <br><br>

												The Business Impact Assessment (BIA) is a critical component of BC/DR planning. It helps identify the critical business processes and systems, and their interdependencies, and assesses the potential impact of disruptions to these processes and systems. (Gordon, 2013).<br><br>

												Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is another key factor in BC/DR planning. It refers to the maximum time allowed for the recovery of critical business processes and systems. (Gordon, 2013).<br><br>

												Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is a measure of how much data an organization can afford to lose in case of a disruption. It determines the frequency of data backups and the maximum tolerable data loss. (Gordon, 2013). <br><br>

												Finally, the text mentions some emerging trends in Information Risk Management, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), Cloud Computing, and Internet of Things (IoT). These trends pose new challenges and require organizations to update their risk management strategies accordingly. (Alam et al., 2018).<br><br>

											<p>
												The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) are critical factors for Disaster Recovery (DR) solutions. RPO determines the amount of data loss a business can tolerate in a disaster scenario, while RTO defines the maximum tolerable downtime. The appropriate RPO and RTO values for DR solutions depend on various factors, such as business requirements, budget, and complexity. <br><br>

												Several typical system solutions are available to meet standby requirements, such as hot standby, warm standby, and cold standby. A hot standby system provides continuous data replication and immediate failover in case of a disaster. A warm standby system has near-real-time data replication and requires manual intervention to failover. A cold standby system involves a backup system that is only activated in case of a disaster.<br><br>

										<h2>Final Reflections</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										As I reflect on the Security and Risk Management module, I realise how important it is to consider all possible risks and vulnerabilities while designing and developing a product or carrying out a security review. The module helped me understand the significance of incorporating security measures right from the initial stages of development. I also learned various techniques and tools to identify risks and vulnerabilities and mitigate them effectively.<br><br>

										As a member of my allocated group, I contributed to team activities by identifying potential security threats and suggesting measures to mitigate them. I also ensured that all team members were aware of the best practices and guidelines for secure development.<br><br>

										Being a part of a group has been a great learning experience for me. I have learned how to further collaborate with team members effectively, communicate ideas clearly, and work towards achieving common goals. It has also helped me develop my problem-solving skills and taught me how to think critically while making important decisions.<br><br>

										Overall, the Security and Risk Management module and my experience as a member of a development team have had a positive impact on my personal and professional development. I now have a better understanding of the importance of applying Risk Management techniques as part of my job and feel more confident in my ability to contribute even further to Risk Management discussions in my organisation.
